## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose

### Production Setup

This application is configured for production use with:

- React frontend built as static files and served by Express
- Node.js backend running in production mode
- Data persistence through host system folder mapping
- All services run through a single port (5000)
- Security headers enabled

All data (uploads and database) is persisted in the `./data` directory, making backups and migration simpler.

### Running with Docker

This application can run in both development and production modes with data persistence through host system folders.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/travel-companion.git
   cd travel-companion
   ```

2. Make the start script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x start.sh
   ```

3. Start the application:
   
   **Development Mode** (with hot reloading):
   ```
   ./start.sh --development
   ```
   
   The application will be available at:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000

   **Production Mode**:
   ```
   ./start.sh
   ```
   or
   ```
   ./start.sh --production
   ```
   
   The application will be available at:
   - http://localhost:5000 (Server handles both frontend and API)

### Running without Docker

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm run install-all
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
